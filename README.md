EE568 Digital Image Processing

Course Syllabus

Credits: 4

Goal: The goal of this course is to introduce to students the basic theory and recent important topics related to digital image processing.

Description: The first part of the course provides the background and basic techniques for digital image processing.  The second part of the course covers various special topics such as image segmentation, image restoration, multi-resolution imaging with wavelet transform, and image registration. The course consists of weekly lectures, homework/labs, and a final project. The homework and final project are specifically designed towards providing hands-on experience on digital image processing. The students will implement an image processing demo for the final project.

Prerequisites: EE 341, Discrete Time Signal Analysis, familiarity with MATLAB or Python, or permission of the Coordinator.

Textbook: Rafael C. Gonzalez and Richard E. Woods, Digital Image Processing, 3nd Ed. Prentice Hall.
